            <div class="center-block col-xs-8">
                <p class="case-study">Jott.ly is a Software as a Service (SaaS) web application which allows its users to create and share content as well as collaborate alongside colleagues within their organization. This was a conceptual project completed during my Bloc UX design apprenticeship. My role was to develop the brand identity along with the design and development of the landing page.</p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="center-block col-xs-8">
                <p class="case-study">I began by interviewing the client to gain deeper understanding of the product, target audience and business goals of the company. I researched competitors such as Evernote and Draft to develop an identity that would make Jott.ly stand out. With that insight, I selected colors that differentiated Jott.ly from the crowd and reflected the professional and easy-going personality the company wanted to portray.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="center-block col-xs-8">
                <p class="case-study">After brainstorming ideas and studying effective logo designs, I designed the logo and revised it multiple times with feedback from the client. The idea behind the logo was to show potential users the power of collaboration through Jott.ly. To illustrate this, I started with a blue that gradually changes into an electric yellow signifying the flow of ideas coming together to generate something new and powerful.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="center-block col-xs-8">
                <p class="case-study">Keeping user needs in mind, I worked on the content and layout of the page to effectively meet business goals. The initial goal of the website was to build a customer base by motivating website visitors to sign up for the free trial. I researched effective ways to layout a webpage and content needed to increase conversions (in this case, sign-ups for the free trial).</p>

            <div class="center-block col-xs-8">
                <p class="case-study">I started the page with a collage to show potential users what they can do with Jott.ly. I followed this section by mentioning specific benefits Jott.ly offers. Tapping into the power of social psychology to increase conversions, I added a social proof section to validate the product. Finally, I placed a second call-to-action button at the bottom of the page for viewers convinced of the value of the product by the content presented throughout the page. Based on this content and layout, I created the wireframe and a high-fidelity mockup. I developed the site with the Skeleton boilerplate using the mobile first approach for a responsive website.</p>

                <p class="case-study">Jott.ly was my first design and development project; it was also my first-hand experience in the iterative design process. There were many instances when I had to design, redesign or simply go back to the drawing board. If Jott.ly was a real startup, I could get an insight on how effective my design is by comparing number of visits to conversions and conversions after viewing content.</p>
